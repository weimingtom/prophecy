Question	 
What does the Socket method setTcpNoDelay() do and when 
should I use it?

Answer 
This controls the TCP_NODELAY socket option. 
TCP_NODELAY disables/enables the use of Nagle's Algorithm to 
control the amount of buffering used when transferring data. 
Nagle's algorithm tries to send full data segments by waiting, 
if necessary, for enough writes to come through to fill up the 
segment.

It's useful to disable the use of Nagle's algorithm 
(setTcpNoDelay(true)) when your communication over that socket 
comprises small packets and where latency is important. 
The classic example that comes to mind is a talk/chat application.

Nagle's algorithm is described in more detail in RFC 896.

Why does SocketConnector send several messages as one message?

For example, I tried using SocketConnector to send "abc" and "def", 
but it sent "abcdef". Is it a MINA bug?

No, this is due to your OS trying to send packets more efficiently 
(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle_algorithm). 
You can enable/disable Nagle's algorithm by a call to 
SocketSessionConfig.setTcpNoDelay(), e.g.:

((SocketSessionConfig) connector.getSessionConfig()).setTcpNoDelay(false)

However, even if you do this you cannot expect one session.write(bytes) 
in MINA to correspond to one TCP packet on your network. 
You should probably implement your own MINA ProtocolDecoder 
to handle the assembly of incoming bytes into message objects. 
The TextLineCodec is a good start if the protocol you're implementing 
is based on text lines. For a more advanced example have a look 
at the SumUp example in the MINA distribution.
